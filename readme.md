Mix - Homework
--------------

I created this repository for put some of my homework, most of then are made in Racket Language. They were made as final work for some courses.


Family-tree
-----------

The first program that a decides to share are a prolog like family-tree made in Racklog. Racklog is an embedding of Prolog-style logic programming in Racket. Embedding” means you don’t lose Racket: You can use Prolog-style and conventional Racket code fragments alongside each other.

    Folder: family-tree/

I made some modification and changed to English file: newMyFamily.rkt, original program: myFamilyLLF.rkt.

    Course: Logical and Functional Languages

Use:

	$ cd family-tree/
	$ drracket myFamilyLLF.rkt &
	> (sister)
	> (brother)
	> (grandfather)
	> (grandmother)
	> (uncle)
	> (aunt)

Work on business intelligence focused on project management. Basically, CPM (Critical Path Method) and PERT (Programme Evaluation Review Technique) are project management techniques, which have been created out to schedule and control complex projects.
